# ShakeNBreak uses the default doped INCAR settings described here: https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doped.VASP_sets.html
# as well as these modifications:
# Changed from doped default:
LCHARG: false  # reduce file sizes
LREAL: Auto  # real-space force projection, runtime speedup with acceptable loss in force accuracy
LWAVE: false  # reduce file sizes
NELM: 40  # slightly reduced NELM to speedup with incomplete SCF convergence far from minimum
NSW: 300  # increased NSW from doped default to allow relaxation from initially distorted structure

# Same as doped but with added comment information in INCAR file:
ALGO: "Normal  # Change to All if ZHEGV, FEXCP/F or ZBRENT errors encountered (done automatically by snb-run)"
IBRION: '2  # Typically more stable / reliable than "1" (RMM-DIIS), but change if ionic convergence is poor (done automatically by snb-run)'
