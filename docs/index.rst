Welcome to ShakeNBreak!
=======================================

``ShakeNBreak`` (``SnB``) is a defect structure-searching method employing
chemically-guided bond distortions to locate ground-state and metastable
structures of point defects in solid materials. |logo|

Main features include:

1. Defect structure generation:

   * Automatic generation of distorted structures for input defects
   * Optionally, input file generation for geometry optimisation with several codes (``VASP``, ``CP2K``, ``Quantum-Espresso``, ``CASTEP`` & ``FHI-aims``)
2. Analysis:

   * Parsing of geometry relaxation results
   * Plotting of final energies versus distortion to demonstrate what energy-lowering reconstructions have been identified
   * Coordination & bonding analysis to investigate the physico-chemical factors driving an energy-lowering distortion
   * Magnetisation analysis (currently only supported for ``VASP``)

The code currently supports ``VASP``, ``CP2K``, ``Quantum-Espresso``, ``CASTEP`` and ``FHI-aims``.
Code contributions to support additional solid-state packages are welcome!

Installation
========================

ShakeNBreak can be installed using ``pip``:

.. code:: bash

  pip install --user shakenbreak

If using ``VASP``, in order for ``ShakeNBreak`` to automatically generate the pseudopotential
input files (``POTCARs``), your local ``VASP`` pseudopotential directory must be set in the ``pymatgen``
configuration file ``$HOME/.pmgrc.yaml`` as follows:

.. code:: bash

  PMG_VASP_PSP_DIR: <Path to VASP pseudopotential top directory>

Within your ``VASP`` pseudopotential top directory, you should have a folder named ``POT_GGA_PAW_PBE``
which contains the ``POTCAR.X(.gz)`` files (in this case for PBE ``POTCARs``). More details given
`here <https://pymatgen.org/installation.html#potcar-setup>`_.

Developer installation
------------------------

For development work, ``ShakeNBreak`` can also be installed from a copy of the source directory:

1. Download ``ShakeNBreak`` source code using the command:

   .. code:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/SMTG-UCL/ShakeNBreak

2. Navigate to root directory:

   .. code:: bash

      cd ShakeNBreak

3. Install the code, using the command:

   .. code:: bash

      pip install -e .

   This command tries to obtain the required packages and their dependencies and install them automatically.

Usage
========================

Python API
----------------

``ShakeNBreak`` can be used through a Python API, as exemplified in the `SnB Python API Tutorial <https://shakenbreak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ShakeNBreak_Example_Workflow.html>`_.

Command line interface
-------------------------

Alternatively, the code can be used via the command line.

The functions provided include:

* ``snb-generate``: Generate distorted structures for a given defect
* ``snb-generate_all``: Generate distorted structures for all defects present int the specified/current directory
* ``snb-run``: Submit geometry relaxations to the HPC scheduler
* ``snb-parse``: Parse the results of the geometry relaxations and write them to a ``yaml`` file
* ``snb-analyse``: Generate ``csv`` files with energies and structural differences between the final configurations
* ``snb-plot``: Generate plots of energy vs distortion, with the option to include a colorbar to quantify structural differences
* ``snb-regenerate``: Identify defect species undergoing energy-lowering distortions and test these distortions for the other charge states of the defect
* ``snb-groundstate``: Save the ground state structures to a ``Groundstate`` directory for continuation runs

More information about each function and its inputs/outputs are available from the
:ref:`CLI section of the docs <cli_commands>` or using ``-h`` help option (e.g. ``snb -h``).

We recommend at least looking through the :ref:`Tutorials <tutorials>` when first starting to use ``ShakeNBreak``, to
familiarise yourself with the full functionality and workflow.

Acknowledgements
========================

``ShakeNBreak`` has benefitted from feedback from many members of the Walsh and Scanlon research groups who have
used / are using it in their work, including Adair Nicolson, Xinwei Wang, Katarina Brlec, Joe Willis,
Zhenzhu Li, Jiayi Cen, Lavan Ganeshkumar, Daniel Sykes, Luisa Herring-Rodriguez, Alex Squires, Sabrine Hachmiouane and
Chris Savory.
Code to identify defect species from input supercell structures was written based on the implementation
in `PyCDT <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2018.01.004>`_ by Broberg *et al.*
