Welcome to ShakeNBreak!
=======================================

``ShakeNBreak`` (``SnB``) is a defect structure-searching method employing
chemically-guided bond distortions to locate ground-state and metastable
structures of point defects in solid materials.

Main features include:

1. Defect structure generation:

   * Automatic generation of distorted structures for input defects
   * Optionally, input file generation for geometry optimisation with several codes (``VASP``, ``CP2K``, ``Quantum-Espresso``, ``CASTEP`` & ``FHI-aims``)
2. Analysis:

   * Parsing of geometry relaxation results
   * Plotting of final energies versus distortion to demonstrate what energy-lowering reconstructions have been identified
   * Coordination & bonding analysis to investigate the physico-chemical factors driving an energy-lowering distortion
   * Magnetisation analysis (currently only supported for ``VASP``)

The code currently supports ``VASP``, ``CP2K``, ``Quantum-Espresso``, ``CASTEP`` and ``FHI-aims``.
Code contributions to support additional solid-state packages are welcome!

Installation
========================

``ShakeNBreak`` can be installed using ``pip``:

.. code:: bash

  pip install shakenbreak

Alternatively if needed, it can also be installed from ``conda`` with:

.. code:: bash

  conda install -c conda-forge shakenbreak


If using ``VASP``, in order for ``ShakeNBreak`` to automatically generate the pseudopotential
input files (``POTCARs``), your local ``VASP`` pseudopotential directory must be set in the ``pymatgen``
configuration file ``$HOME/.pmgrc.yaml`` as follows:

.. code:: bash

  PMG_VASP_PSP_DIR: <Path to VASP pseudopotential top directory>

Within your ``VASP`` pseudopotential top directory, you should have a folder named ``POT_GGA_PAW_PBE``
which contains the ``POTCAR.X(.gz)`` files (in this case for PBE ``POTCARs``). Please refer to the
`doped Installation docs <https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html>`_ if you have
difficulty with this.

Developer installation
------------------------

For development work, ``ShakeNBreak`` can also be installed from a copy of the source directory:

1. Download ``ShakeNBreak`` source code using the command:

   .. code:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/SMTG-Bham/ShakeNBreak

2. Navigate to root directory:

   .. code:: bash

      cd ShakeNBreak

3. Install the code, using the command:

   .. code:: bash

      pip install -e .

   This command tries to obtain the required packages and their dependencies and install them automatically.

Usage
========================

Python API
----------------

``ShakeNBreak`` can be used through a Python API, as exemplified in the `SnB Python API Tutorial <https://shakenbreak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ShakeNBreak_Example_Workflow.html>`_.

Command line interface
-------------------------

Alternatively, the code can be used via the command line.

The functions provided include:

* ``snb-generate``: Generate distorted structures for a given defect
* ``snb-generate_all``: Generate distorted structures for all defects present int the specified/current directory
* ``snb-run``: Submit geometry relaxations to the HPC scheduler
* ``snb-parse``: Parse the results of the geometry relaxations and write them to a ``yaml`` file
* ``snb-analyse``: Generate ``csv`` files with energies and structural differences between the final configurations
* ``snb-plot``: Generate plots of energy vs distortion, with the option to include a colorbar to quantify structural differences
* ``snb-regenerate``: Identify defect species undergoing energy-lowering distortions and test these distortions for the other charge states of the defect
* ``snb-groundstate``: Save the ground state structures to a ``Groundstate`` directory for continuation runs

More information about each function and its inputs/outputs are available from the
:ref:`CLI section of the docs <cli_commands>` or using ``-h`` help option (e.g. ``snb -h``).

We recommend at least looking through the :ref:`Tutorials <tutorials>` when first starting to use ``ShakeNBreak``, to
familiarise yourself with the full functionality and workflow.


Code Compatibility
========================

:code:`ShakeNBreak` is built to natively function using :code:`pymatgen` :code:`Defect` objects (`docs available here <https://materialsproject.github.io/pymatgen-analysis-defects/>`_) and be compatible with the most recent version of :code:`pymatgen`. If you are receiving :code:`pymatgen`-related errors when using :code:`ShakeNBreak`, you may need to update :code:`pymatgen` and/or :code:`ShakeNBreak`, which can be done with:

.. code:: bash

   pip install --upgrade pymatgen shakenbreak


:code:`ShakeNBreak` can take :code:`pymatgen` :code:`Defect` objects as input (to then generate the trial distorted
structures), **but also** can take in :code:`pymatgen` :code:`Structure` objects, :code:`doped` defect dictionaries or
structure files (e.g. :code:`POSCAR`\s for :code:`VASP`) as inputs. As such, it should be compatible with any defect code
(such as `doped <https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_, `pydefect <https://github.com/kumagai-group/pydefect>`_,
`PyCDT <https://github.com/mbkumar/pycdt>`_, `PyLada <https://github.com/pylada/pylada-defects>`_,
`DASP <http://hzwtech.com/files/software/DASP/htmlEnglish/index.html>`_, `Spinney <https://gitlab.com/Marrigoni/spinney/-/tree/master>`_,
`DefAP <https://github.com/DefAP/defap>`_, `PyDEF <https://github.com/PyDEF2/PyDEF-2.0>`_...) that generates these files.
Please let us know if you have any issues with compatibility, or if you would like to see any additional features added to :code:`ShakeNBreak` to make it more compatible with your code.
