    Returns list of configurations after applying a Monte Carlo local
    rattle.
    Compared to the standard Monte Carlo rattle, here the displacements
    tail off as we move away from the defect site.

    Rattling atom ``i`` is carried out as a Monte Carlo move that is
    accepted with a probability determined from the minimum
    interatomic distance :math:`d_{ij}`.  If :math:`\\min(d_{ij})`` is
    smaller than :math:`d_{min}`` the move is only accepted with a low
    probability.

    This process is repeated for each atom a number of times meaning
    the magnitude of the final displacements is not *directly*
    connected to ``rattle_std``.

    This function has been adapted from https://gitlab.com/materials-modeling/hiphive

    Warning:
        Repeatedly calling this function *without* providing different
        seeds will yield identical or correlated results. To avoid this
        behavior it is recommended to specify a different seed for each
        call to this function.

    Notes:
        The procedure implemented here might not generate a symmetric
