    Applies rattle and bond distortions to the unperturbed defect structure

            - fractional coordinates (for vacancies) or
            - defect site index (other defect types).

    Args:
        defect_entry (:obj:`DefectEntry`):
            The defect to distort, as a pymatgen `DefectEntry` object.
        num_nearest_neighbours (:obj:`int`):
            Number of defect nearest neighbours to apply bond distortions to.
        distortion_factor (:obj:`float`):
            The distortion factor to apply to the bond distance between
            the defect and nearest neighbours. Typical choice is between
            0.4 (-60%) and 1.6 (+60%).
        local_rattle (:obj:`bool`):
            Whether to apply random displacements that tail off as we move

            Standard deviation (in Angstroms) of the Gaussian distribution
            from which random atomic displacement distances are drawn during
            rattling. Default is set to 10% of the bulk nearest neighbour
            distance.
        d_min (:obj:`float`):
            Minimum interatomic distance (in Angstroms) in the rattled
            structure. Monte Carlo rattle moves that put atoms at
            distances less than this will be heavily penalised.
            Default is to set this to 80% of the nearest neighbour
            distance in the defect supercell (ignoring interstitials).
        active_atoms (:obj:`list`, optional):
            List (or array) of which atomic indices should undergo Monte Carlo
            rattling. Default is to apply rattle to all atoms except the
            defect and the bond-distorted neighbours.
        distorted_element (:obj:`str`, optional):
            Neighbouring element to distort. If None, the closest neighbours
            to the defect will be chosen.
            (Default: None)
        verbose (:obj:`bool`):
            Whether to print distortion information.
            (Default: False)
        **mc_rattle_kwargs:
            Additional keyword arguments to pass to `hiphive`'s
            `mc_rattle` function. These include:
            - max_disp (:obj:`float`):
                Maximum atomic displacement (in Angstroms) during Monte Carlo
                rattling. Rarely occurs and is used primarily as a safety net.
                (Default: 2.0)
            - max_attempts (:obj:`int`):
                Limit for how many attempted rattle moves are allowed a single atom.
            - active_atoms (:obj:`list`):
                List of the atomic indices which should undergo Monte
                Carlo rattling. By default, all atoms are rattled.
                (Default: None)
            - seed (:obj:`int`):
                Seed for setting up NumPy random state from which rattle
                random displacements are generated.

                Additional keyword arguments to pass to `hiphive`'s
                `mc_rattle` function. These include:
                - stdev (:obj:`float`):
                    Standard deviation (in Angstroms) of the Gaussian distribution
                    from which random atomic displacement distances are drawn during
                    rattling. Default is set to 10% of the nearest neighbour distance
                    in the bulk supercell.
                - d_min (:obj:`float`):
                    Minimum interatomic distance (in Angstroms) in the rattled
                    structure. Monte Carlo rattle moves that put atoms at distances
                    less than this will be heavily penalised. Default is to set this
                    to 80% of the nearest neighbour distance in the bulk supercell.
                - max_disp (:obj:`float`):
                    Maximum atomic displacement (in Angstroms) during Monte Carlo
                    rattling. Rarely occurs and is used primarily as a safety net.
                    (Default: 2.0)
                - max_attempts (:obj:`int`):
                    Limit for how many attempted rattle moves are allowed a single atom.
                - active_atoms (:obj:`list`):
                    List of the atomic indices which should undergo Monte
                    Carlo rattling. By default, all atoms are rattled.
                    (Default: None)
                - seed (:obj:`int`):
                    Seed from which rattle random displacements are generated. Default
                    is to set seed = int(distortion_factor*100) (i.e. +40% distortion ->
                    distortion_factor = 1.4 -> seed = 140, Rattled ->

                    Standard deviation (in Angstroms) of the Gaussian distribution
                    from which random atomic displacement distances are drawn during
                    rattling. Default is set to 10% of the nearest neighbour distance
                    in the bulk supercell.

                    Minimum interatomic distance (in Angstroms) in the rattled
                    structure. Monte Carlo rattle moves that put atoms at distances
                    less than this will be heavily penalised. Default is to set this
                    to 80% of the nearest neighbour distance in the bulk supercell.
                - max_disp (:obj:`float`):
                    Maximum atomic displacement (in Angstroms) during Monte Carlo
                    rattling. Rarely occurs and is used primarily as a safety net.
                    (Default: 2.0)
                - max_attempts (:obj:`int`):
                    Limit for how many attempted rattle moves are allowed a single atom.
                - active_atoms (:obj:`list`):
                    List of the atomic indices which should undergo Monte
                    Carlo rattling. By default, all atoms are rattled.
                    (Default: None)
                - seed (:obj:`int`):
