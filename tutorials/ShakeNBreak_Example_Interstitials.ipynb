    "Defect distortions often follow the change in electron count when introducing that defect to the system. For the neutral Cd vacancy ($V_{Cd}^0$) for example, the removal of Cd and its two valence electrons means that local distortions are likely to involve two neighbouring Te atoms moving closer/further apart to accommodate the broken bonds. For the singly-charged vacancy, we are likely to have just one neighbouring Te moving, etc. This isn't always the case, but typically points us in the right direction to search the PES, and has been confirmed to yield the best performance (see SI of [_Identifying the ground state structures of point defects in solids_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-023-00973-1) Mosquera-Lois, Kavanagh, Walsh and Scanlon 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the `SnB` method involves distorting the initial bond lengths around the defect for a mesh of trial distortions, with the number of neighbours to distort dictated by the change in valence electron count, performing coarse $\\Gamma$-only (`vasp_gam`) relaxations and then comparing the final energies, to see if we identify any lower energy defect structures."

    "Using the `incar_settings` optional argument for `Distortions.write_vasp_files()` above, we can also specify some custom `INCAR` tags to match our converged `ENCUT` for this system and optimal `NCORE` for the HPC we will run the calculations on. More information on the distortions generated can be obtained by setting `verbose = True`. Note that any `INCAR` flags that aren't numbers (e.g. `{\"IBRION\": 1}`) or True/False (e.g. `{\"LREAL\": False}`) need to be input as strings with quotation marks (e.g. `{\"ALGO\": \"All\"}`)."
